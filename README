LICENSE:
	Please refer to the LICENSE text file in the same directory for license information.

INSTALLATION:
1. Install the latest version of bjam (Boost Jam)
	http://www.boost.org/

	(on OSX with macports you can just do: sudo port install boost-jam)

2. Clone the repo to a directory: git://github.com/halzy/secret_listener.git
	> git clone git://github.com/halzy/secret_listener.git

3. Download the latest version of boost, and unarchive it into secret_listener's parent directory

4. Create a file called boost-build.jam in secret_listener's parent directory with this as it's contents:
	boost-build ./boost_1_40_0/tools/build/v2 ;

5. Correct the path in that file to point to the right directory. You'll probabaly only have to change the boost version numbers. 

6. Edit the existing jamroot.jam file the secret_listener directory and change the boost version numbers and path to the version of boost you just unarchived.

7. In terminal, go into the secret_listener directory and type: bjam

8. Profit!
